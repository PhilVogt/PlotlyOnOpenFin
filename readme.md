## OpenFin with Plotly and Dash

### Options
You have 2 options for integrating your Plotly/Dash components with Openfin. The first is to run some clientside javascript and the second is to generate your own Custom React components which get transpiled into Python. At that point you can use them as Python functions inside the Python scripts that generate your Plotly/Dash UI's.

We've got examples of both approaches in this repository.

### Clienside Javascript
To see this example working, change directory into the ClientSideJS folder, then follow the instructions in the readme.md file.

### Custom React Components
To see this example working, change directory into the CustomComponent folder. Check the readme.md file in there for the details.
